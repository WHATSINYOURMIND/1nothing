# CREATION OF DATA FRAME IN PANDAS
# DATA SETS IN PANDAS ARE USUALLY MULTI DIMENSIONAL TABLES CALLED DATAFRAMES

import pandas as pd
mydataset = {
'cars': ["BMW", "Volvo", "Ford"],
'passings': [3, 7, 2]
}
myvar = pd.DataFrame(mydataset)
print(myvar)
print()
print(myvar.loc[[1,2]])
print()

# PANDAS SERIES - IT IS LIKE A COLUMN IN A TABLE
# Can label the index as well
# key value pairs can also be used like a dictionary
# Named indexes , locating row

a = [1, 7, 2, 10, 12]
myvar = pd.Series(a, index=["x","y","z","zz","yy"])
print(myvar)

#loading a file into a dataframe
# df = pd.read_csv(file_name)

# If you have a large DataFrame with many rows, Pandas will only return the first 5 rows, and the last 5 rows:
# Print the DataFrame without the to_string() method:
