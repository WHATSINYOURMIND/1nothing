# This program is to draw a ONE line from one point to another

# Notes of markers
# plt.plot(x_points, y_points, 'o')
# There are many more markers available like - x, X, o, P, *, s, p, H

# format string fmt
# You can use also use the shortcut string notation parameter to specify the marker.
# This parameter is also called fmt, and is written with this syntax:

# line color - specifies the color of the line
# line_width - width of the line
# Title of graph , x_label of graph , y_label of graph
