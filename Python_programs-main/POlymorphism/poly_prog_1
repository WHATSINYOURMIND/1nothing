# 1) Python program to demonstrate in-built poly-morphic functions

# len() being used for a string
print(len("geeks"))

# len() being used for a list
print(len([10, 20, 30]))


# 2) polymorphism in simple functions
def add(x,y,z=0):
    return x+ y+z

# drivers code
print(add(2,3))
print(add(2,3,4))


# 3) polymorphism with class methods
# 4) Method overriding in python to achieve poylmorphism
#     - it is achieved using the concept of inheritance, without that overriding cannot be understood
